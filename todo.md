  * we should be able to put animation of Sky's time property in a transformation
* a Scene's Actions should be a map of assets and lists of transformations
  * our transformations need to be more versatile
* make recording easier
* test howler + web audio recorder for audio exporting
* correct animations for time lost during processing?
