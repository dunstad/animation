* figure out how Player and Scene can be easy to use
* make recording easier
* wrap vivus in methods so it uses the AnimationQueue
* make animation helper config parameter object a class (mostly so it's easy to document)
* make the tests automatic (basically add asserts for where the object ought to be)
* make some tests for Sky
* test howler + web audio recorder for audio exporting
* correct animations for time lost during processing?
