* make recording smooth, figure out how to render one frame per animation update in Snap
  * need to make mina's frame function accessible
  * probably requires switching off the .min library and editing it directly
* wrap vivus in methods so it uses the AnimationQueue
* make animation helper config parameter object a class (mostly so it's easy to document)
* make some tests for Sky
* test howler + web audio recorder for audio exporting
* correct animations for time lost during processing?
